All this is about creating a tutorial which brings front the power of programming in solving ctf tasks.
I aim to build upon an intuition with which one can solve CTF tasks with programming without overly relying on online tools and tools in general.
The only tool we need is Python and its always amusing interpreter!

## What kind of content will be there?
Anything! although I am more inclined towards cryptography (and I want to show a point that it is beyond stupid ciphers and cracking hashes), the content would be aimed towards more or less towards general scripting/programming for CTF challenges :smile:

## What if you get stuck?
Always feel free to DM(direct message) on [discord](https://discord.com/new), Username: deuterium#1689.
Or any other convenient medium of choice.
