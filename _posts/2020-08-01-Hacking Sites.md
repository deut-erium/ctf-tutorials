There are plethora of challenge/hacking sites where one could find cool challenges any time of the year.  
Some of them are ranked and have their own scoreboards while others are there just for learning sake.
This is by no means an updated list, I will need to update it
<!--more-->
While one can find running CTFs all year round, CTFs have there own cons
- The challenges/problems are shortlived. The lifetime of a typical CTF is 2 days and server based challenges would be typically running for a week or two.
- The range of challenges in a CTF is not vast given the time constraints, and usually less focussed on a single concept.

Enter the always running challenge sites to practice! While some of them are focussed on a specific topic say SQLi, others are more general. Check out the description of each site to know more.  
The order of sites is purely coincidental, it by no means tries to order the awesomeness of sites!!  
Various `tags`{:.info} shall be mentioned beneath each site to specify the challenge categories.
